/**
* Minimal / Fast (static + JSON)
Host static site on Vercel/Netlify (recommended) â€” automatic deploy from GitHub, free tier, easy.
Put teams.json in a simple public folder or GitHub repo â€” good for quick demos.

Serverless Data / API
AWS + API Gateway + Lambda (Node) â€” create endpoints /teams and /players that read from S3 or DynamoDB.
Good when you need custom logic or secure endpoints.
Start: create Lambda that returns a JSON file (for learning).
AWS Amplify â€” simplifies hosting + backend (GraphQL or REST) with auth.
Rapid fullstack for front-end devs.
S3 + CloudFront â€” store teams.json and static assets there; use CloudFront for CDN. Simple, cheap.

Managed Databases / BaaS (less infra)
Supabase (Postgres + REST/Realtime) â€” simple SQL DB + auth in minutes.
Firebase (Firestore or Realtime DB) â€” easy for demos, real-time features.
Appwrite (open-source alternative).

Future Improvement Ideas (Cloud Integration ðŸ’¡)
Since you mentioned AWS or cloud service, hereâ€™s how you could expand:
Host your JSON data in AWS S3 (as public objects) â€” your fetch() calls would then load from S3 URLs.
fetch("https://your-bucket.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/teams.json")
Later, replace the JSON files with an API Gateway + Lambda that returns team data dynamically.
Use AWS Amplify to deploy the whole frontend
Note: walk through those cloud steps when your local setup is stable

Persisting Scores later in Fixtures.jsx
Backend:
Serverless: Vercel Functions / Netlify Functions that accept POST /api/fixtures/:id to update JSON in S3 or a small DB.
AWS: API Gateway + Lambda to write updates to DynamoDB or S3.
Supabase or Firebase (easier): direct DB with REST or realtime updates.

Security: only allow authenticated admins to update scores. Use JWT or provider (Auth0, Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth) and authorize updates in your API.
